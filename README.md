Key Insights:
1.	Female customers are prone to churn as compared to male customers
2.	Customers with credit type as “Fair” are under high risk of churn, hence banks can initiate credit restructuring processes to prevent churning of such customers
3.	Over the period of time (2016-2019) there is a increase in the number of active customers but similarly there is increase in inactive members
4.	Year 2017 saw the highest churn rate with peaks in the month of January, March, April, October, November, December all the months having churn rate more than 25%. This can be investigated and necessary preventive actions can be initiated to prevent future churns at such mass levels
